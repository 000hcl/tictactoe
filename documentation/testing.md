#Testing

## Manual testing

Virtually all testing has been done manually by playing against the AI in both of the game's modes. It seems to work correctly.

## Unit tests

The automatic unit tests cause problems with imports that I can't figure out in time. The tests cannot be run.

## performance testing

During the game the AI is times. The time taken for it to decide on a move is printed above the current board.

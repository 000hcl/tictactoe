# Week 6 report

## What did I do this week?

I began to change the find_winner function. I wanted it to take into account the amount of "winning" rows. It is not yet complete.

## How has the project progressed?

Not much. I think it will work a little better now? It is still clearly a work in progress.

## What did I learn?

Peer reviews can be really useful. The first one I received brought into attention something I had not considered before. Since I test with my own playstyle, other
 people's strategies can be really valuable when trying to find things that don't work as they perhaps should.

## Problems?

Time management.

## What next?

Finishing the new system, tests. I think if I can finish the find_winner function in such a way that the board only needs to be iterated over once instead of
 ~4 times as it is currently, then it will be a little bit faster.

Hours used: 2

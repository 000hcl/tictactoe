# Week 2 report

## What did I do this week?

This week I tried to implement a working, adjustable game board for tic tac toe, and a basic minimax algorithm for it as well.

## How has the project progressed?

The project seems to be progressing, and all new features seem to be working.

## What did I learn?

I tried out the pure minimax algorithm with a 4x4 board and it is clearly too inefficient on its own. There is a clear wait time, even on the 3x3 board.

## Problems?

I've had a lot of bugs to fix, and at times I did not know if the problems came from small mistakes or from a lack of understanding of the algorithm. 

27.7: The minimax algorithm prioritizes indices that are small when each move seem to give an equal outcome. So the algorithm "gives up" early when I'd like it
 to challenge the player even though it might lose.

## What next?

27.7: I think I'll try to implement alpha-beta pruning first.

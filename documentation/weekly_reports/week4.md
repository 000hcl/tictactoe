# Week 4 report

## What did I do this week?

This week I've tried to get the AI to work fast enough on a 30x30 grid. It is not yet perfect, but it is somewhat playable. 

## How has the project progressed?

I believe I'm close to finishing the game itself, however the tests are still undone and the documentation needs updating. Sometimes the AI does strange decisions
 which I have to look into later.

## What did I learn?

I need to put more time into this. 


## Problems?

I think I am on the right track, but I'm not completely sure. 

## What next?

I am not yet completely satisfied with the AI. I can already think of a few ways to improve it, but I'm running out of time for this week. (a game ending win is clearly better
 than a sure, future win, but they are considered the same currently)

Hours used: 11

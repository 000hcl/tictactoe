# Week 5 report

## What did I do this week?

I found bugs and tried to make the AI work correctly at this stage, rather than quickly.

## How has the project progressed?

It seems to be working correctly when the AI starts and when the player starts. However, it takes a few seconds for the AI to make decisions. It is playable.

## What did I learn?

A working AI does not need to check a game tree that deeply.

## Problems?

I am having a hard time with finding time to work on the project.

## What next?

Tests, seeing if I can make the AI faster. I have some ideas in mind.

Hours used: 5

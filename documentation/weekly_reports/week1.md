# Week 1 report

## What did I do this week?

This week I tried to research different algorithms so I could decide which topic to pick. I picked the minimax algorithm because I thought I understood it well enough.
Quite some time went into setting up the project and writing md files. 

## How has the project progressed?

The project has not yet progressed at all. Some documentation has been written.

## What did I learn?

The logic behind the minimax algorithm.

## Problems?

The course material does not mention much about python alternatives to Maven and Gradle, but I assume Poetry works fine. 

## What next?

I think I will attempt to make a working AI for a regular 3x3 game to make sure that I actually know what I'm doing, before doing anything else.
